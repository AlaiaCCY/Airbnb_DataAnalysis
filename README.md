# Airbnb_Housing_Price

Project type: Data analysis project

Group Members: Zongjie Yin, Chunyu Chen

Situation: Airbnb is a widely-used website and app that serves as a platform for a two-sided market, catering to both landlords and renters. Our goal is to predict the daily price of houses listed on Airbnb in New York City. This prediction is based on various factors such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and square footage of the house. The aim is to offer a relative price range for similar houses, providing renters with a wider range of affordable and higher-quality housing options while enabling landlords to maximize their income in a shorter period of time.

Action: We performed data cleaning by removing irrelevant data and filling in missing values. We also utilized data visualization techniques, including Word Clouds, Base Maps, and Heatmaps. Additionally, we conducted feature engineering, such as one-hot encoding for categorical variables. To predict the rental price, we employed machine learning methods such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, and we utilized grid search and cross-validation techniques.

Result: The lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) we achieved was 56.53. Based on these results, we were able to provide actionable insights and recommendations to stakeholders, including pricing strategies.
