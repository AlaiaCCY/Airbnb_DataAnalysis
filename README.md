# Airbnb_Housing_Price

Project type: Data analysis project

Group Members: Zongjie Yin, Chunyu Chen

Situation: Airbnb is a widely-used website and app that serves as a platform for a two-sided market, catering to both landlords and renters. Our goal is to predict the daily price of a given house in New York City listed on Airbnb based on provided information such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and square footage of the house, aiming at maximizing benefits for both landlords and renters by offering a relative price range for similar houses, allowing renters to have a wider range of affordable and higher-quality housing options, while also enabling landlords to earn more income in a shorter period of time.
